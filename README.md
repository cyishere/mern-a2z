This is a simple app made by the MERN stack which I learn from [this tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/mern-stack-a-to-z-part-1/).

I changed the CSS framework from Bootstrap to Bulma and used React Hooks.

\*MERN: MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js.

## How to use

Change the `<username>`, `<password>`, `<dbname>` in the "/backend/config/default.json" file to your own.
